## Watchers

This is an extremely trivial test app written using [RubyMotion](http://rubymotion.com). It fetches all of the public [Gristmill](http://gristmill.io) GitHub repositories and lists them in a table view. When you tap/click on a repository it displays an alert with the number of watchers.
